# Radar

Radar adds a compact, camera-oriented HUD radar for **Warhammer 40,000: Darktide**. It is built to surface the targets that matter most during live missions, nearby pickups, objective items, deployed support tools, environment interactables, expedition points of interest, teammates, and high-priority enemies, while keeping the presentation configurable from the mod options menu.

## What's New in 1.3.0

- Adds small **up** and **down** arrows for supported item markers, plus settings to control when the arrows appear and when vertically distant items are hidden.
- Fixes **Heretic Idol** markers so active idols show reliably on the radar.
- Adds anchor-based radar positioning with corner anchors plus horizontal and vertical offsets for more consistent placement across different screen layouts.
- Adds a **radar background opacity** slider and an optional **Infinite** boss marker range mode.
- Adds per-category **Icon size (%)** sliders, so you can resize major marker groups independently while keeping the final combined size capped at **4.0x**.

## Feature Overview

- Tracks nearby pickups, materials, mission items, event items, deployables, environment interactables, expedition POIs, teammates, and priority enemies on a single radar.
- Projects markers relative to your current facing, so the radar rotates with your view instead of acting like a fixed minimap.
- Supports **square** and **circle** radar frames, plus configurable **outline** and **guide** styles for both shapes.
- Lets you adjust **radar size**, **scan range**, **radar background opacity**, **vertical arrow range**, **vertical hide threshold**, and **maximum marker count**.
- Supports optional **icon scaling with radar size**.
- Adds per-category **Icon size (%)** sliders for common pickups, materials, objective items, expedition markers, deployables, enemies, players, event items, and debug markers.
- Supports separate marker styles for **enemies** and **teammates**. Enemies support **Icon only** and **Marked icon**, teammates support **Icon only**, **Marked icon**, **Dot only**, and **Marked dot**.
- Includes a **toggle radar on or off** keybind, so you can hide or restore the radar during a mission without opening the options menu.
- Supports anchor-based **radar positioning** with **Radar anchor**, **Horizontal offset**, **Vertical offset**, **Steps per input**, and dedicated movement keybinds for nudging the radar **left**, **right**, **up**, or **down**.
- Adds small **up** and **down** arrows to supported item markers when they are above or below you and still within the configured arrow range.
- Lets you hide supported item markers that are far above or below your current level, which helps reduce clutter in multi-level areas.
- Adds dedicated **Expedition POI** support for numbered **Sites of Interest** opportunity markers, plus dedicated icons for **Deadsider Sanctuaries**, **Data Reliquary Harvesters**, **Main Objective**, **Valkyrie Extraction Zone**, and **Valkyrie Arrival Zone**, with an option to ignore the normal range limit for these markers.
- Adds environment markers for **Medicae Station**, **Power Socket**, and **Heretic Idol**, and active heretic idols now appear reliably on the radar.
- Supports per-marker display mode dropdowns for supported artwork-based markers with **Artwork**, **Icon**, and **Off** modes. **Artwork** remains the default, and older boolean settings are migrated automatically.
- Recolors the remaining formerly white pickup icons with more semantic colors, including ammo, grenades, medicae-related markers, power sockets, and heretic idols.
- Keeps the radar position clamped to the visible UI space, so moving or resizing it does not push it off-screen.
- Colors the radar center dot from the local player HUD slot color.
- Supports class-icon and dot-based teammate presentations instead of a single fixed teammate marker style.
- Adds an optional **Infinite** boss marker range mode, which is especially useful for expeditions.
- Exposes category-based checkboxes, style dropdowns, display mode dropdowns, and group-based icon size sliders for common pickups, materials, objective items, expedition items, expedition POIs, environment markers, deployed items, enemies, teammates, event items, and debug markers.
- Includes optional **debug logs** and an **unknown pickups** toggle for discovery and troubleshooting.
- Includes a groundwork **highlighting** option, but the actual highlighting behavior is currently still under development.

## In-Game Radar Examples

The screenshots below show both radar styles during an expedition mission. They illustrate the camera-oriented layout, mixed pickup categories, teammate markers, expedition POIs, and priority targets in live gameplay.

### Circle Radar

  <img src="doc/img/square_radar_3.png" width="31%" alt="Square radar example 3" />
</p>

### Vertical item arrows

The new vertical item arrows add a small **up** or **down** overlay to supported item markers when the item is on a different level but still close enough horizontally to matter. You can also tune when these arrows appear and when vertically distant items are hidden entirely.

  <img src="doc/img/material_expeditions_loot_down.png" width="50" alt="Item marker with down arrow example" />
</p>

## Display and Behavior

Both radar shapes support the same outline and guide options, and the frame rendering is tuned so crosshairs fit the active frame, view guides reach the border cleanly, circle range rings stay thin and solid, circle outlines remain visually continuous, and square dotted outlines render as proper dots.

### Square radar variants

## Artwork, Icon, Off display modes

Supported artwork-based markers now use dropdowns instead of simple booleans. Each supported marker can be shown as **Artwork**, **Icon**, or **Off**.

- **Artwork** uses the original item artwork or pickup art.
- **Icon** uses a simplified HUD icon material with an ARGB tint.
- **Off** hides that specific marker entirely.
- Existing saved boolean settings are migrated automatically, with old `true` values becoming **Artwork** and old `false` values becoming **Off**.

### Positioning and Toggle Use

- Use **Toggle radar on or off** to quickly hide or restore the radar while staying in the mission.
- Use **Radar anchor** first to choose the screen corner the radar should stick to.
- Use **Horizontal offset** and **Vertical offset** when you want to place the radar precisely relative to that anchor.
- Use **Move radar left**, **right**, **up**, and **down** when you want to fine-tune the placement in live gameplay with key presses.
- **Steps per input** controls how large each movement increment is, which makes it easier to do either quick repositioning or small adjustments.
- Anchor-based placement is automatically clamped against the current UI space, so the widget stays within the visible screen area even after changing size or resolution scale.

### Marker Rules

- **Enemies** use dedicated danger icons and, in marked mode, red bracket accents.
- **Teammates** use archetype icons or dot presentations, plus their runtime HUD slot color.
- **The center dot** uses the local player HUD color instead of a fixed green.
- **Supported artwork-based markers** can now switch between artwork mode, simplified icon mode, or be disabled entirely.
- **Supported item markers** can show a small **up** or **down** arrow when they are above or below you within the configured arrow range, and can be hidden entirely when they are too far above or below your level.
- **Environment markers** cover medicae stations, power sockets, and heretic idols, and active idols now appear reliably on the radar.
- **Boss markers** can follow the normal radar range or ignore it completely by switching **Boss marker range** to **Infinite**.
- **Expedition POIs** use numbered scanner-map glyphs for opportunity markers, can also reflect player-marked states in expedition colors, use dedicated icons for transition, harvester, main objective, extraction, and arrival locations, can optionally ignore the normal radar range limit, and are filtered to the active expedition section so outdated location markers do not linger after section changes.

## Target Markers

The legend below follows the option groups exposed by `Radar_data.lua`. The preview tiles were generated from the included `doc/img` assets and the ARGB values used by the HUD presentations.

These markers are driven by expedition navigation data rather than standard pickup scanning. **Sites of Interest** can appear as unmarked opportunity markers or player-marked variants, while the remaining expedition POIs use dedicated objective-style icons. They can optionally ignore the normal radar range limit, are filtered to the currently active expedition section, and clear outdated location markers when the active section changes.

## Display Modes and Color Rules

The readme preview icons follow the HUD presentations used by the mod.

### Artwork mode

Artwork mode keeps the original item artwork for supported markers. This is the default mode for all markers that support the new display dropdowns.

Examples:
- Crates use the pickup artwork tile.
- Diamantine, Plasteel, Salvage, Tech-Remnants, and Dropped Tech-Remnants keep their resource artwork.
- Expeditions pocketables such as Void Shell, the landmines, and the strike markers keep their existing item artwork.

### Icon mode

Icon mode swaps supported markers to simplified HUD icon materials with dedicated ARGB colors.

| Marker family | Icon material | ARGB |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Crates | `content/ui/materials/icons/generic/loot` | `(255, 225, 200, 136)` |
| Diamantine | `content/ui/materials/hud/interactions/icons/environment_generic` | `(255, 70, 130, 220)` |

| Void Shell | `content/ui/materials/hud/interactions/icons/void_shield` | `(255, 181, 166, 66)` |

### Semantic recolors for regular markers

The remaining formerly white pickup icons were recolored so marker families read more clearly at a glance.

| Marker | ARGB | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ammo Tin | `(255, 240, 210, 80)` | Small ammo pickup |
| Ammo Stash | `(255, 240, 210, 80)` | Large ammo pickup |
| Large Ammunition Crate | `(255, 240, 210, 80)` | Expeditions ammo container |
| Deployable Ammo Crate | `(255, 240, 210, 80)` | Team deployable ammo |
| Grenade | `(255, 205, 156, 77)` | Grenade pickup |
| Pocketable Ammo Crate | `(255, 240, 210, 80)` | Ammo pickup family tint |
| Pocketable Medical Crate | `(255, 38, 205, 26)` | Medical supply tint |
| Medicae Station | `(255, 38, 205, 26)` | Environment medical interaction |

### Runtime-dynamic colors

Not every radar marker uses a fixed readme tint:

- **Teammates** use the class icon for the detected archetype and take their color from the active HUD slot color at runtime.
- **The radar center dot** also uses the local player's HUD color.

## Requirements

- **[Darktide Mod Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/8)**
- **[Darktide Mod Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/19)**

## Notes

- The radar is intended for active gameplay and suppresses itself outside valid runtime states such as hub and menu contexts.
- Expedition POIs are filtered to the active expedition section, and **Data Reliquary Harvesters** are only shown inside the relevant **Deadsider Sanctuary** where they can actually be used.
- Artwork-based markers now use localized **Artwork**, **Icon**, and **Off** dropdowns where supported, and older saved boolean settings are migrated automatically.
- Supported item markers can show vertical **up** and **down** arrows within the configured range, and can be hidden when they are too far above or below your current level.
- The **Environment** group adds dedicated toggles for **Medicae Station**, **Power Socket**, and **Heretic Idol**, and active heretic idols now appear reliably on the radar.
- Anchor-based positioning uses a corner anchor plus horizontal and vertical offsets, which makes radar placement more consistent across different screen layouts.
- Each major marker group now includes an **Icon size (%)** slider, and the final combined marker size is capped at **4.0x**.
- Boss markers can use **Normal** or **Infinite** range.
- The highlighting option is visible in the configuration, but the actual highlighting behavior is still work in progress.
- Marker previews in this readme were generated from the included template assets and documentation images so the legend matches the mod's configured presentations as closely as possible.
- The gameplay screenshots in this readme were captured during an expedition mission and show both radar frame styles in live use.
- Localization entries are included for the new positioning, icon size, vertical arrow, boss range, and background opacity settings, so the new options show up consistently with the rest of the translated mod menu.
